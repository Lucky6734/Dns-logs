11. Detect DNS Tunneling (Unusual Query Patterns)


index=_* OR index=* sourcetype=dnslogs
| stats count by domain_name
| where count > 100
| sort -count


This query identifies domains that have been queried more than 100 times, which could be an indication of DNS tunneling or other malicious activities.
________________


12. Query Volume from a Specific IP over Time


index=_* OR index=* sourcetype=dnslogs
| search src_ip="192.168.1.100"
| timechart span=1h count


This query provides a timechart of DNS queries from a specific source IP (192.168.1.100) to analyze patterns over time.
________________


13. Domains with High Query Count in a Specific Time Window


index=_* OR index=* sourcetype=dnslogs
| search _time>=relative_time(now(), "-1d@d") AND _time<=now()
| stats count by domain_name
| sort -count


This query identifies the most queried domains over the past 24 hours, helping detect any recent spikes in DNS activity.
________________


14. Detection of New Domains (First Time Query)


index=_* OR index=* sourcetype=dnslogs
| stats first(_time) as first_query_time by domain_name
| where first_query_time > relative_time(now(), "-1d@d")
| sort -first_query_time


This query finds newly queried domains (queried for the first time in the last 24 hours), which could be suspicious.
________________


15. Query Frequency Per Hour


index=_* OR index=* sourcetype=dnslogs
| eval hour_of_day=strftime(_time, "%H")
| stats count by hour_of_day
